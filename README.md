# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
### Overview of Election Audit
A Colorado Board of Elections employee asked me to perform analysis for an audit of a recent local congressional election. I was asked to deliver the following:
1. The total votes cast in the congressional election.
2. A breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
3. The county with the largest number of votes.
4. A breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
5. Which candidate won the election, their vote count, and their percentage of the total votes.
